## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- BEM

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to
- use Google Fonts on a webpage
- select HTML elements using CSS class selectors
- specify lengths in rem units
- organize stylesheets using the BEM methodology.

### Continued development

Particular topics where further development on my part is needed include
- deciding whether to use margins or padding to add space around content
  - **Version 2 update:** Based on ideas I picked up while studying Bootstrap 5, 
  I generally add `* { margin-top: 0; }` to my stylesheet 
  and use `margin-bottom` to adjust spacing between elements. 
  Also, for elements with fixed width and padding,
  I find `box-sizing: border-box;` to be most convenient.
- specifying image widths and/or heights in a responsive way
  - **Version 2 update:** While not needed for this particular project, the 
  `<picture>` tag allows you to specify different images across breakpoints.
- **Version 3 update:** the placement of CSS code such as `html {font-size: 15px;}` within BEM methodology. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - W3Schools's comprehensive tutorial on CSS, the language used to style webpages.
- [ScreenRuler](https://gnomecoder.wordpress.com/screenruler/) - An onscreen ruler for Ubuntu. This helped me extract lengths in pixels from design images.
- [BEM 101](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) - This is a good place to start learning about BEM.
