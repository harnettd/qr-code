## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to
- use Google Fonts on a webpage
- select HTML elements using CSS class selectors
- specify lengths in rem units.

### Continued development

Particular topics where further development on my part is needed include
- deciding whether to use margins or padding to add space around content
- specifying image widths and/or heights in a responsive way.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google's collection of open source fonts.
- [W3Schools CSS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - W3Schools's
comprehensive tutorial on CSS, the language used to style webpages.
- [ScreenRuler](https://gnomecoder.wordpress.com/screenruler/) - An onscreen
ruler for Ubuntu. This helped me extract lengths in pixels from design images.
